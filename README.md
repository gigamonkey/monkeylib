Yet Another Markup Parser
=========================

Inspired by the concision of the Markup parser I wrote in Haskell
using the Parsec library, I decided to see if I could do better back
in Common Lisp, the first language I implemented Markup in. While I
had to implement a somewhat fancy macro to do it, the grammar here is
even more streamlined than the Haskell version.

This is the markup system I used for writing [both](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/)
my [books](http://www.codersatwork.com/).
