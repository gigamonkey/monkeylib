Yet Another Markup Parser
=========================

Inspired by the concision of the Markup parser I wrote in Haskell
using the Parsec library, I decided to see if I could do better back
in Common Lisp, the first language I implemented Markup in. While I
had to implement a somewhat fancy macro to do it, the grammar here is
even more streamlined than the Haskell version.
