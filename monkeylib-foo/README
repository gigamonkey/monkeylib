This code is basically deprecated. Much of the good stuff has been
moved out into separate projects, monkeylib-text-output,
monkeylib-text-languages, and monkeylib-html. There is still stuff in
here for generating CSS and Javascript as well as my goofy Lispscript
language but as I'm not sure how useful that is, I'm don't have any
immediate plans to break them out as separate projects.
