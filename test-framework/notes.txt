- Need a way to get the total results for a test function that
  contains internal calls to check.

- DEFTEST should not use the name as the name of a function so a test
  can be defined with the same name as the function it tests.

- Would be nice to have tests auto register in relation to their
  package so we can define a TEST-PACKAGE function that runs all the
  tests defined in the pcakage.



  ;; define a function
  (defun foo (x) (whatever x))

  ;; define a test that tests that function
  (deftest foo () (check (= (foo 123) 456)))

  ;; define a test that takes a parameter.
  (deftest bar (x) (check (= (bar x) (* 10 x))))

  (defsuite smoketest ()
    (test foo)
    (test bar 0)
    (test bar 1)
    (test bar 100)
    (test baz))


  ;; test the named function
  CL-USER> (test foo)

  ;; Another way
  CL-USER> (test #'foo) 

  ;; Run a test function with arguments.
  CL-USER> (test bar 10)

  ;; run all the tests associated with a package
  CL-USER> (test-package :com.gigamonkeys.the-package)
