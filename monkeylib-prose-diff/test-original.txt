** Tokenization tests

Depending on how we split text into tokens when computing the LCS we
can get slightly better or worse diffs. The remaining paragraphs in
this section show some of the issues.

Foo bar baz and stuff. Ideally there's one addition and one deletion.

One foo bar baz and stuff. Ideally there's one addition and one deletion.

Two foo bar baz and stuff. Ideally there's one addition and one deletion.

Three foo bar baz and stuff. Ideally there's one addition and one deletion.

Four I hope there's only one deletion and addition following: foo bar baz

Five I hope there's only one deletion and addition following: foo bar baz and stuff.

A sentence that ends with foo. Ideally foo will not be struck out in the diff.

A sentence that ends with foo. Ideally the only diff will be the addition of quotes.
